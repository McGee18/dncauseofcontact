<h1>Interpreting Business Requirements to Create a Cause of Contact Form Using HTML, CSS & Javascript.</h1>
<p> Business requirements given, assumptions had to be made before creation. First attempt at test-driven development used to create project.<p>
<p> I would love to see a working completed code structure that satisfies all conditions - especially for the areas I couldnt work out. PLease let me know/feel free to contribute solutions on my git hub - HTTPS: https://github.com/McGee18/dncontactform.git // SSH: git@github.com:McGee18/dncontactform.git <p>
<p> Specific requirements included:</p>

<ul> 
<li> Fields to input name, email, credit/debit card number.</li>
<li> Submission button to submit input.</li>
<li> Validation checks to be done against each field - First Name Last Name, User@domain, Valid digit length  (luhn's algorithm if possible).</li>
<li> Notification to appear as soon as invalid submission attempted - error messages used.</li>
<li> Text colour to change invalid entries based upon required fields - couldnt get to work for name - works for email and card number.</li>
<li> Design to follow wireframe design provided - colour schemes, text format & page design.</li>
<li> Submission button to generate email to designated inbox - unable to work out using Javascript and HTML alone - managed to have HTML generate email to send, but not to send automatically or include generated fields.</li>
</ul>
